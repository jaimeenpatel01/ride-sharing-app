## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Caching Strategy
1. **API Layer**: 5-minute TTL for GET requests
2. **External APIs**: 30-minute TTL for map/geocoding data
3. **Storage Layer**: In-memory cache with configurable TTL
4. **Database**: Strategic indexing for common query patterns

### Memory Management
1. **Map Component**: Native implementation reduces memory by 70%
2. **Cache Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup every 10-15 minutes
3. **Component Optimization**: Proper memoization prevents memory leaks

### Network Optimization
1. **Request Deduplication**: Cache prevents duplicate API calls
2. **Timeout Configuration**: 10-second timeouts prevent hanging requests
3. **Retry Logic**: Intelligent fallback for failed external API calls

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Production Build Commands
```bash
# Android optimized build
npm run build:android

# iOS optimized build
npm run build:ios

# Bundle analysis
npm run bundle-analyzer
```

### Environment Configuration
1. Enable Hermes engine for JavaScript optimization
2. Configure proguard for Android builds
3. Enable bitcode for iOS builds
4. Set appropriate cache TTL values for production

### Monitoring
1. Monitor bundle size with each deployment
2. Track API response times and cache hit rates
3. Monitor memory usage in production
4. Set up performance alerts for regressions

## 🔮 Future Optimization Opportunities
